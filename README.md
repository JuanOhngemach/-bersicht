# <a name="introduction"></a>Intro
This is a List of useful Übersicht widgets to make your screen look beautiful. Those were all not created by myself. This is just a List of working ones that I personally like. Those and more widgets are to be found [here](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht-widget).
There is also a little wallpaper folder included if you want to toy around.
